Project Description:

The Pay Slip Generation System (PSG) is a simple software tool designed to automate the process of generating monthly salary slips for employees. It helps organizations or HR departments to easily calculate and display employee salary details including allowances, deductions, and net salary.
This system accepts inputs such as employee name, designation, ID, basic salary, bonus, and tax, then performs the necessary calculations and outputs a neatly formatted pay slip.
